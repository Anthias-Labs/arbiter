# CLI Installation with Cargo

## Prerequisites

Before installing Arbiter, ensure that you have Rust installed. You can install and verify your Rust installation from the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

The Arbiter CLI works alongside [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) and aims to provide a similar CLI interface of setting up and interacting with Arbiter projects. Install Foundry from the [official website](https://getfoundry.sh/).

## Installing the Arbiter CLI

### Install using Cargo

Once Rust is installed, you can install Arbiter from the package registry using Cargo. To do this, just run:
```bash
cargo install arbiter
```

You can now run `arbiter --help` to verify your installation and view the help menu.

### Building From Source
Install Git, if you haven't already. There are many online guides on how to install Git on different devices, including one from [Github](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).

Once you're done with the above, you can install Arbiter by cloning the repository. The local crate can then be used to install the Arbiter binary on your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/primitivefinance/arbiter.git
cargo install --path ./arbiter
```

You can now run `arbiter --help` to verify your installation and view the help menu.

## Interacting with the Arbiter CLI
Arbiter provides a Foundry-like CLI experience. You can initialize new projects, generate bindings and execute simulations using the CLI.

To create a new Arbiter project:
```bash
arbiter init your-new-project
cd your-new-project
```

This initializes a new Arbiter project with a template. You can generate the bindings again by running:

```bash
arbiter bind
```

The template is executable at this point and you can run it by running:

```bash
cargo run
```

You can load or write your own smart contracts in the templates `contracts/` directory and begin writing your own simulations. Arbiter treats Rust smart-contract bindings as first-class citizens. The contract bindings are generated via Foundry's forge command. arbiter bind wraps forge with some convenience features that will generate all your bindings to `src/bindings` as a rust module. Foundry power-users are welcome to use forge directly. You can also manage project dependencies using git submodules via `forge install`. The [Foundry book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-install) provides further details on managing project dependencies and other features.
