// * Probably should move labels to world instead of on the environment.
// * One thing that is different about the Arbiter world is that give a bunch of
//   different channels to communicate with the Environment's tx thread. This is
//   different from a connection to a blockchain where you typically will just
//   have a single HTTP/WS connection. What we want is some kind of way of
//   having the world own a reference to a provider or something
// * Can add a messager as an interconnect and have the manager give each world
//   it owns a clone of the same messager.
// * The worlds now are just going to be revm worlds. We can generalize this
//   later.
// * Can we give the world an address book??
