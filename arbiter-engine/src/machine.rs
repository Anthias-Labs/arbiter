// I think we should have the `sync` stage of the behavior receive the client
// and messager and then the user can decide if it wants to use those in their
// behavior.

// Could typestate pattern help here at all? Sync could produce a `Synced` state
// behavior that can then not have options for client and messager. Then the
// user can decide if they want to use those in their behavior and get a bit
// simpler UX.
