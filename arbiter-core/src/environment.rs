//! The `environment` module provides abstractions and functionality for
//! handling the Ethereum execution environment. This includes managing its
//! state, interfacing with the EVM, and broadcasting events to subscribers.
//!
//! The key integration for the environment is the Rust EVM [`revm`](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm).
//! This is an implementation of the EVM in Rust that we utilize for processing
//! raw smart contract bytecode.
//!
//! Core structures:
//! - `Environment`: Represents the Ethereum execution environment, allowing for
//!   its management (e.g., starting, stopping) and interfacing with agents.
//! - `EnvironmentParameters`: Parameters necessary for creating or modifying
//!  an `Environment`.
//!     - `BlockSettings`: Enum indicating how block numbers and timestamps are
//!       moved forward.
//!     - `GasSettings`: Enum indicating the type of gas settings that will be
//!     used to make clients pay gas.
//! - `Instruction`: Enum indicating the type of instruction that is being sent
//!  to the EVM.
//! - `Outcome`: Enum indicating the type of outcome that is being sent back
//!  from the EVM.
//! - `EnvironmentError`: Enum indicating the type of error that can be thrown
//!  by the EVM.
//! - `State`: Enum indicating the current state of the environment.
//! - `Socket`: Provides channels for communication between the EVM and the
//!   outside world.
//! - `EventBroadcaster`: Responsible for broadcasting Ethereum logs to
//!   subscribers.

/// ## Communication
/// The dominant feature is the
/// [`EVM`](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/blob/main/crates/revm/src/evm.rs)
///  and its connections to the "outside world".
/// The Ethereum Virtual Machine
/// ([`EVM`](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/blob/main/crates/revm/src/evm.rs))
/// which is a stack machine that processes raw smart contract bytecode and
/// updates a local database of the worldstate of an Ethereum simulation.
/// Note, the worldstate of the simulation Ethereum environment should not be
/// confused with the [`State`] of the environment here! The [`Environment`]
/// will route transactions sent over channels to the stack machine
/// [`EVM`](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/blob/main/crates/revm/src/evm.rs)
/// to process smart contract interactions.
///
/// Allows for the initialization, starting, stopping, and pausing of the EVM
/// execution. It provides channels for sending transactions to the EVM and for
/// receiving results or broadcasting events to any subscribers via the
/// `Socket` field exposed only as `pub(crate)`.
///
/// ## Status
/// The environment also maintains its current
/// state, which can be one of the following:
/// - [`State::Initialization`],
/// - [`State::Running`],
/// - [`State::Paused`],
/// - [`State::Stopped`].
///
/// A state of [`State::Paused`] is recoverable and a state of
/// [`State::Stopped`] is not recoverable. [`State::Initialization`] is adopted
/// only prior to the [`Environment`] being ran and marks that this
/// [`Environment`] may still change in configuration.
///
/// ## Controlling Block Rate
/// The blocks for the [`Environment`] are chosen using a Poisson distribution
/// via the [`SeededPoisson`] field. The idea is that we can choose a rate
/// parameter, typically denoted by the Greek letter lambda, and set this to be
/// the expected number of transactions per block while allowing blocks to be
/// built with random size. This is useful in stepping forward the
