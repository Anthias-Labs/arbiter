//! The `middleware` module provides functionality to interact with
//! Ethereum-like virtual machines. It achieves this by offering a middleware
//! implementation for sending and reading transactions, as well as watching
//! for events.
//!
//! Main components:
//! - [`RevmMiddleware`]: The core middleware implementation.
//! - [`RevmMiddlewareError`]: Error type for the middleware.
//! - [`Connection`]: Handles communication with the Ethereum VM.
//! - `FilterReceiver`: Facilitates event watching based on certain filters.

/// A middleware structure that integrates with `revm`.
///
/// [`RevmMiddleware`] serves as a bridge between the application and `revm`'s
/// execution environment, allowing for transaction sending, call execution, and
/// other core functions. It uses a custom connection and error system tailored
/// to Revm's specific needs.
///
/// This allows for `revm` and the [`Environment`] built around it to be treated
/// in much the same way as a live EVM blockchain can be addressed.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Basic usage:
/// ```
/// // Get the necessary dependencies
/// // Import `Arc` if you need to create a client instance
/// use std::sync::Arc;
///
/// use arbiter_core::{manager::Manager, middleware::RevmMiddleware};
///
/// // Create a manager and add an environment
/// let manager = Manager::new();
/// manager.add_environment("example_env", 1.0, 42).unwrap();
///
/// // Retrieve the environment to create a new middleware instance
/// let middleware = RevmMiddleware::new(manager.environments.borrow().get("example_env").unwrap(), Some("test_label".to_string()));
/// let client = Arc::new(&middleware);
/// ```
/// The client can now be used for transactions with the environment.
/// Use a seed like `Some("test_label".to_string())` for maintaining a
/// consistant address across simulations and client labeling. Seeding is be
/// useful for debugging and post-processing.
